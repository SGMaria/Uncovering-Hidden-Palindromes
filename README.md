## Notes

### Take in Count

- The core of this program is palindromes.js since it extracts all substrings and then check which ones are palindromes before saving.
- app.js is centered in index.html. In other works, app.js manages the funcionality of the page and its items.
- The main objetive of index.html is to show how palindromes.js works in a more appealing view than the console.
- The table grows, it doesn't have a funtion of clearing it or saving the results. Once the page is refreshed, it will restart.
